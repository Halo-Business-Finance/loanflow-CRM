# Contact Entities Security Fix

## Problem Description
**Security Issue:** Customer Personal Information Could Be Stolen by Hackers
**Level:** ERROR
**Risk:** HIGH

The `contact_entities` table contained highly sensitive personal data including:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Credit scores
- Income information
- Business addresses
- Loan amounts

This data was accessible to authenticated users and could potentially be stolen by hackers or malicious insiders through:
- Overly permissive RLS policies
- Direct table access without proper masking
- No field-level encryption for sensitive data

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Strict Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- **Owner-Only Access**: Users can only view, update, and delete their own contact entities
- **Super Admin Override**: Only super admins can access all contact data
- **No Anonymous Access**: All operations require authentication
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts are logged for security monitoring

### 2. Field-Level Encryption
- **Encrypted Fields Table**: Created `contact_encrypted_fields` table for sensitive data
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Uses existing `encrypt_token()` function for strong encryption
- **Searchable Hashes**: Maintains partial masked data for search functionality
- **Automatic Encryption**: Sensitive fields are automatically encrypted on insert/update

### 3. Data Masking Functions
- **Role-Based Masking**: Different levels of data access based on user roles
  - **Owners/Super Admins**: Full decrypted access
  - **Admins/Managers**: Partially masked data
  - **Other Roles**: Minimal data access
- **Secure Access Function**: `get_masked_contact_data()` provides controlled data access
- **Audit Trail**: All data access is logged with security events

### 4. Protected Sensitive Fields
The following fields are now encrypted and protected:
- `email` - Encrypted with partial masking (user@ex**)
- `phone` - Encrypted with partial masking (123***890)
- `credit_score` - Encrypted and masked (***) 
- `income` - Encrypted and protected
- `loan_amount` - Encrypted with masked display

### 5. Secure API Functions
- **encrypt_contact_field()**: Securely encrypts sensitive contact data
- **get_masked_contact_data()**: Returns appropriately masked data based on user role
- **Role validation**: All functions validate user permissions before data access

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New encrypted fields table
CREATE TABLE contact_encrypted_fields (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_id uuid REFERENCES contact_entities(id),
  field_name text NOT NULL,
  encrypted_value text NOT NULL,
  field_hash text NOT NULL, -- For searching
  created_at timestamp with time zone,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone
);

-- Strict RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can only view own contacts"
ON contact_entities FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Client-Side Security
- **useSecureContacts Hook**: Provides secure contact management
- **Encrypted Data Handling**: Automatically encrypts sensitive fields
- **Role-Based UI**: Shows appropriate data based on user permissions
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without data leakage

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Events
All contact data access is logged with:
- User ID and role
- Accessed contact ID
- Data access level (full/masked/minimal)
- Timestamp and IP address
- Security event severity

### Alert Triggers
- High-severity alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Medium-severity alerts for admin data access
- Low-severity alerts for owner data access

## Compliance & Best Practices

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: Field-level encryption and data masking
- **PCI DSS**: Secure handling of financial data
- **Zero Trust**: All access requires explicit permission

### Security Standards
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields
- **Access Control**: Strict RBAC with audit logging
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is exposed
- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuous security event monitoring

## Migration Impact

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing functionality preserved
- Gradual encryption of existing data
- Transparent data access for authorized users

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal impact on query performance
- Efficient encrypted field lookups
- Optimized masking functions

## Testing & Verification

The security fix has been verified to:
1. ✅ Prevent unauthorized contact data access
2. ✅ Encrypt sensitive personal information
3. ✅ Maintain application functionality
4. ✅ Provide appropriate role-based access
5. ✅ Log all security events for monitoring

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Monitor access patterns and update policies
2. **Key Rotation**: Implement encryption key rotation schedule
3. **Advanced Masking**: Consider dynamic masking based on data sensitivity
4. **Compliance Review**: Regular review of data protection compliance
