# Session Security Hijacking Fix

## Security Issue Fixed
**Issue**: User Session Information Could Be Hijacked
**Level**: Critical Error
**Date Fixed**: August 14, 2025

## Problem Description
Multiple session-related tables (`active_sessions`, `secure_sessions`, `user_sessions`) had overly permissive RLS policies that allowed public read access to session tokens, IP addresses, device fingerprints, and user agents. This sensitive information could be exploited for session hijacking attacks.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Found
1. **System can manage secure sessions** - Policy with `USING (true)` bypassed all security
2. **System can create sessions** - Unrestricted session creation
3. **Public access to session tokens** - Sensitive authentication data exposed
4. **Device fingerprints exposed** - Security identifiers accessible to unauthorized users

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Removed Overly Permissive Policies
Dropped dangerous policies that bypassed security:
- `System can manage secure sessions` with `USING (true)`
- `System can manage sessions` with `WITH CHECK (true)`
- `System can create sessions` with unrestricted access

### 2. Secure Session Management Functions
Created comprehensive secure functions for session handling:

#### `create_secure_session()`
- **Session Limit Enforcement**: Maximum 5 concurrent sessions per user
- **Token Encryption**: All session tokens encrypted using `encrypt_token()`
- **Device Validation**: Device fingerprinting for session identity
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for session creation
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes oldest sessions when limit exceeded

#### `validate_session_security()`
- **Risk Scoring System**: Calculates session risk based on multiple factors
- **IP Change Detection**: Monitors for suspicious IP address changes
- **User Agent Validation**: Detects device switching or spoofing
- **Activity Monitoring**: Tracks session inactivity patterns
- **Automatic Termination**: Deactivates suspicious sessions automatically

#### `cleanup_expired_sessions()`
- **Automated Cleanup**: Removes expired and inactive sessions
- **Multi-table Cleanup**: Cleans all session-related tables
- **Activity Logging**: Tracks cleanup operations for audit

### 3. Strict RLS Policies
Implemented ironclad access controls:

#### Active Sessions
- **User-Only Access**: Users can only view their own sessions
- **No Direct Creation**: All session creation must use secure functions
- **Update Restrictions**: Users can only modify their own session activity
- **Admin Monitoring**: Read-only access for security administrators

#### Secure Sessions
- **Function-Only Creation**: Blocks all direct INSERT operations
- **Ownership Validation**: Strict user ID matching for all operations
- **Enhanced Protection**: Additional security layers for sensitive operations

#### User Sessions
- **Complete Lockdown**: No direct creation or modification allowed
- **View-Only Access**: Users can only view their own session data
- **Admin Oversight**: Security monitoring access for administrators

### 4. Enhanced Security Features

#### Device Fingerprinting
- **Browser Characteristics**: Canvas fingerprinting, screen resolution, timezone
- **Hardware Detection**: Platform, language, and capability detection
- **Unique Identification**: Generates consistent device signatures

#### Risk Assessment
- **IP Address Monitoring**: Detects location changes (+30 risk points)
- **User Agent Tracking**: Identifies device/browser changes (+20 risk points)
- **Activity Patterns**: Monitors for unusual session behavior (+10 risk points)
- **Automatic Response**: Sessions with risk score ≥50 are terminated

#### Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **Session Creation**: Logs all new session establishments
- **Validation Attempts**: Tracks all session verification requests
- **Security Incidents**: Records suspicious activity and automatic responses
- **Table Access**: Monitors all session table interactions

### 5. Frontend Security Components

#### Enhanced useSessionSecurity Hook
- **Automatic Validation**: Periodic session security checks every 5 minutes
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitors user interactions for session freshness
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Generates unique device identifiers
- **IP Detection**: Tracks network location changes
- **Threat Response**: Automatic logout for compromised sessions

#### SessionSecurityManager Component
- **Session Monitoring**: Real-time view of all active user sessions
- **Device Information**: Browser, platform, and device type identification
- **Session Termination**: Individual or bulk session termination
- **Activity Timeline**: Last activity and session expiry tracking
- **Security Alerts**: Warnings for suspicious session activity

## Migration Applied
The security fix was applied via database migration that:
1. Removed all overly permissive session policies
2. Created secure session management functions with encryption
3. Implemented strict user-only access controls
4. Added comprehensive audit logging and monitoring
5. Enhanced session validation with risk assessment

## Security Validation
- **Session Token Encryption**: All tokens stored with AES encryption
- **Device Binding**: Sessions tied to specific device fingerprints
- **IP Monitoring**: Automatic detection of location changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time threat scoring and response
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all session operations

## Result
The session hijacking vulnerability has been completely eliminated:
- ✅ All session data access restricted to owners only
- ✅ Session tokens encrypted and protected from exposure
- ✅ Device fingerprinting prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Real-time threat detection with automatic response
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring
- ✅ Secure session management through controlled functions

This fix ensures that session information cannot be accessed by unauthorized users and provides robust protection against session hijacking attacks through multi-layered security controls.
