# Settings → Database → Connection Pooling
```
- [ ] Verify connection pooling is enabled (default: enabled)
- [ ] Set max connections based on expected load:
  - Small: 25 connections

  - Large: 100+ connections
- [ ] Monitor connection usage in production

#### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Review edge function rate limits
- [ ] Configure auth endpoint rate limits
- [ ] Set up IP-based rate limiting for sensitive operations

### 2. Environment Variables Documentation

Create `.env.production` (DO NOT commit to repo):
```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Already in use)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://gshxxsniwytjgcnthyfq.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# Production Settings
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_APP_ENV=production

# External Service Keys (Configure in Supabase Secrets)
# - GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY (for address autocomplete)
# - RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID (for phone integration)
# - RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET
# - MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID (for Microsoft auth)
# - MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET
# - ADOBE_API_KEY (for document viewing)
```

**Supabase Secrets Setup:**
```bash
# Add secrets via Supabase Dashboard:
# Settings → Edge Functions → Manage Secrets
# Or via CLI:
supabase secrets set GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
supabase secrets set RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
# ... etc
```

- [ ] All API keys moved to Supabase Secrets
- [ ] No secrets committed to Git repository
- [ ] `.env` files added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Production environment variables documented

### 3. Authentication & Security Flows

#### Email Verification

- [ ] Verify email templates are branded
- [ ] Configure SMTP settings (or use Supabase defaults)

#### Password Reset
- [ ] Test password reset flow
- [ ] Verify reset link expiration (default: 1 hour)
- [ ] Test with production email addresses

#### MFA Setup
- [ ] Verify MFA enforcement for admin roles
- [ ] Test MFA setup and login flow
- [ ] Document recovery code process
- [ ] Test MFA reset for role changes

### 4. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
```bash
# Use tools like k6, Artillery, or Apache Bench
# Example: Test concurrent users
k6 run --vus 50 --duration 5m load-test.js
```
- [ ] Test with expected concurrent users (e.g., 50-100)
- [ ] Verify response times < 200ms for critical operations
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Check edge function cold start times

#### Database Performance
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to check slow queries
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time,
  max_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
- [ ] Identify and optimize slow queries
- [ ] Verify index usage with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] Check for missing indexes

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting

#### Supabase Monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for:
  - Database CPU > 80%
  - Disk space > 80%
  - Edge function errors > 5%
  - Auth failed login attempts > 100/hour
- [ ] Configure email/SMS notifications
- [ ] Set up Slack/Discord webhooks for critical alerts

#### External Monitoring
Recommended tools:
- **Uptime Monitoring**: UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or Better Uptime
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry (add to React + Edge Functions)
- **Analytics**: PostHog or Plausible (privacy-focused)

```bash
# Install Sentry (optional but recommended)
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/vite-plugin
```

- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (ping every 5 minutes)
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Set up user analytics (optional)

### 6. Security Hardening

#### Supabase Dashboard Audit
- [ ] Review all RLS policies for correctness
- [ ] Run database linter in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Check for exposed tables without RLS
- [ ] Verify edge function authentication

#### Security Scan
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# Database → Database Roles → Check permissions
```
- [ ] Verify `anon` role has minimal permissions
- [ ] Ensure `authenticated` role is properly scoped
- [ ] Check for any public access to sensitive tables

### 7. Final Code Review

#### Remove Development Code
- [ ] Remove all `console.log` (use logger instead)
- [ ] Remove debug flags and test data
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Remove commented-out code

#### Check Dependencies
```bash
# Check for outdated or vulnerable packages
npm audit
npm outdated
```
- [ ] Update all critical security patches
- [ ] Document any known vulnerabilities with mitigations

#### Build Optimization
```bash
# Run production build and check size
npm run build
# Check dist/ folder size
```
- [ ] Verify bundle size is reasonable (< 2MB total)
- [ ] Check for large dependencies
- [ ] Ensure code splitting is working
- [ ] Test lazy-loaded components

### 8. Deployment Steps

#### Pre-Deploy
```bash
# 1. Run final tests
