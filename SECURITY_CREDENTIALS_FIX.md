# Security Credentials Compromise Fix

## Issue Description
**Level:** ERROR  
**Issue:** Security Credentials Could Be Compromised

Tables like `email_accounts`, `mfa_settings`, and `ringcentral_accounts` contained authentication tokens, MFA secrets, and API credentials that could potentially be accessed by unauthorized users, creating a risk of external system compromise.

## Root Cause
- Overly permissive or missing RLS policies on credential tables
- Lack of comprehensive access monitoring for sensitive credential operations
- Missing emergency access controls with proper audit trails

## Fix Applied

### 1. Strict Owner-Only Access Policies
- **mfa_settings table**: Implemented strict RLS policy allowing only account owners access to their MFA settings
- **ringcentral_accounts table**: Implemented strict RLS policy allowing only account owners access to their RingCentral credentials  
- **email_accounts table**: Verified existing secure policies (already had proper owner-only access)

### 2. Emergency Admin Access with Full Auditing
- Created `validate_credential_access()` function that logs ALL access attempts to credential tables
- Added emergency super admin access policies with mandatory audit logging
- Every credential access attempt is logged with severity levels and full context

### 3. Real-time Security Monitoring
- Added `monitor_credential_table_access()` trigger function for all credential table operations
- Monitors INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on sensitive tables
- Logs all operations to security events table for threat detection

### 4. Enhanced Security Event Logging
- Critical level events for super admin emergency access
- High level events for all credential access attempts
- Medium level events for routine credential operations
- Complete audit trail with user roles, timestamps, and IP addresses

## Tables Secured
1. **mfa_settings** - MFA secrets and authentication settings
2. **ringcentral_accounts** - RingCentral API credentials and tokens
3. **email_accounts** - Email account OAuth tokens and credentials

## Security Policies Implemented
- `Strict owner-only access to MFA settings`
- `Emergency super admin MFA access with audit`
- `Strict owner-only access to RingCentral accounts`
- `Emergency super admin RingCentral access with audit`
- Verified existing secure email account policies

## Functions Created
- `validate_credential_access()` - Validates and logs credential access attempts
- `monitor_credential_table_access()` - Monitors all credential table operations

## Impact
- ✅ Credentials are now strictly limited to account owners only
- ✅ All credential access attempts are logged and monitored
- ✅ Super admin emergency access requires explicit validation and generates critical alerts
- ✅ Real-time threat detection for credential table access
- ✅ Complete audit trail for compliance and security monitoring

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. Only authenticated users can access their own credentials
2. Super admins have emergency access with full audit logging
3. All credential operations are monitored and logged
4. No unauthorized access to external system credentials is possible
5. Existing functionality remains intact

This fix addresses the critical security vulnerability while maintaining operational functionality and adding comprehensive security monitoring capabilities.
