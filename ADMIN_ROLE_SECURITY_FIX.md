# Admin Role Assignment Security Fix

## Security Issue Fixed
**Issue**: Admin Role Assignment Could Allow Privilege Escalation
**Level**: Critical Error
**Date Fixed**: August 14, 2025

## Problem Description
The original `user_roles` table had an overly permissive policy "System can insert roles" with `WITH CHECK (true)`, which could allow unauthorized role assignments or privilege escalation if system authentication was compromised.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Removed Insecure Policies
- Dropped the "System can insert roles" policy that allowed unrestricted role insertion
- Blocked all direct INSERT, UPDATE operations on `user_roles` table

### 2. Secure Role Assignment Function
Created `assign_user_role()` function with comprehensive security checks:
- **Role Hierarchy Enforcement**: Users cannot assign roles higher than their own
- **Admin-Only Assignment**: Only admins (level 3+) can assign roles
- **Super Admin Protection**: Only super admins can assign super admin roles
- **Self-Demotion Prevention**: Super admins cannot demote themselves
- **MFA Requirement**: Admin/Super Admin role changes require MFA verification

### 3. Secure Role Revocation Function
Created `revoke_user_role()` function with strict controls:
- **Super Admin Only**: Only super admins can revoke roles
- **MFA Requirement**: Admin role revocations require MFA verification
- **Self-Protection**: Users cannot revoke their own roles

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) System
Implemented comprehensive MFA system for sensitive role changes:
- **MFA Token Generation**: `generate_role_change_mfa_verification()` creates secure tokens
- **Token Verification**: `verify_role_change_mfa()` validates tokens with expiration
- **Secure Token Storage**: `role_change_mfa_verifications` table with 5-minute expiration
- **Failed Attempt Logging**: All MFA failures are logged for security monitoring

### 5. Enhanced Audit Logging
All role changes are comprehensively logged:
- **Security Events**: Critical/high severity events for all role changes
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed before/after role change tracking
- **MFA Events**: Separate logging for MFA requests, verifications, and failures
- **Failed Attempt Tracking**: All unauthorized attempts are logged

### 6. Strict RLS Policies
New Row-Level Security policies enforce proper access:
- **View Access**: Users can only see their own roles + admins see all
- **Insert Block**: All direct inserts blocked - must use secure functions
- **Update Block**: All direct updates blocked - must use secure functions
- **Delete Protection**: Only super admins can delete roles directly

## Technical Implementation

### Database Functions Created
1. `assign_user_role(user_id, role, reason, mfa_verified)` - Secure role assignment
2. `revoke_user_role(user_id, reason, mfa_verified)` - Secure role revocation
3. `generate_role_change_mfa_verification()` - MFA token generation
4. `verify_role_change_mfa(token)` - MFA token verification

### Tables Created
- `role_change_mfa_verifications` - Secure MFA token storage with expiration

### Components Created
- `useSecureRoleManagement` hook - Frontend integration with secure functions
- `SecureRoleManager` component - UI for secure role management with MFA

## Security Features

### Role Hierarchy Protection
```json
{
  "super_admin": 4,
  "admin": 3, 
  "manager": 2,
  "loan_originator": 1,
  "loan_processor": 1,
  "funder": 1,
  "underwriter": 1,
  "closer": 1,
  "agent": 1,
  "tech": 0,
  "viewer": 0
}
```

### MFA Requirements
- **Required For**: super_admin and admin role assignments/revocations
- **Token Lifetime**: 5 minutes
- **Single Use**: Tokens can only be used once
- **Secure Generation**: 32-byte random tokens (hex encoded)

### Audit Trail
- Every role change generates security events
- Failed MFA attempts are logged with IP tracking
- All function calls include detailed metadata
- Separate audit log entries for compliance

## Migration Applied
The security fix was applied via database migration that:
1. Removed insecure policies
2. Created secure functions with comprehensive validation
3. Implemented MFA verification system
4. Added strict RLS policies
5. Enhanced audit logging capabilities

## Result
The admin role assignment vulnerability has been completely mitigated. The system now enforces:
- ✅ Strict role hierarchy controls
- ✅ MFA requirement for admin role changes  
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ Prevention of privilege escalation
- ✅ Self-demotion protection
- ✅ Secure token-based verification

This fix ensures that role assignments can only be performed by authorized users through secure, audited functions with proper multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations.
